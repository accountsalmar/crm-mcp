The field names\n    should be the names of the addons to install (when selected). Upon action\n    execution, selected boolean fields (and those only) will be interpreted as\n    addons to install, and batch-installed.\n\n    Additional addons\n    -----------------\n\n    It is also possible to require the installation of an additional\n    addon set when a specific preset of addons has been marked for\n    installation (in the basic usage only, additionals can't depend on\n    one another).\n\n    These additionals are defined through the ``_install_if``\n    property. This property is a mapping of a collection of addons (by\n    name) to a collection of addons (by name) [#]_, and if all the *key*\n    addons are selected for installation, then the *value* ones will\n    be selected as well. For example::\n\n        _install_if = {\n            ('sale','crm'): ['sale_crm'],\n        }\n\n    This will install the ``sale_crm`` addon if and only if both the\n    ``sale`` and ``crm`` addons are selected for installation.\n\n    You can define as many additionals as you wish, and additionals\n    can overlap in key and value. For instance::\n\n        _install_if = {\n            ('sale','crm'): ['sale_crm'],\n            ('sale','project'): ['sale_service'],\n        }\n\n    will install both ``sale_crm`` and ``sale_service`` if all of\n    ``sale``, ``crm`` and ``project`` are selected for installation.\n\n    Hook methods\n    ------------\n\n    Subclasses might also need to express dependencies more complex\n    than that provided by additionals. In this case, it's possible to\n    define methods of the form ``_if_%(name)s`` where ``name`` is the\n    name of a boolean field. If the field is selected, then the\n    corresponding module will be marked for installation *and* the\n    hook method will be executed.\n\n    Hook methods take the usual set of parameters (cr, uid, ids,\n    context) and can return a collection of additional addons to\n    install (if they return anything, otherwise they should not return\n    anything, though returning any \"falsy\" value such as None or an\n    empty collection will have the same effect).\n\n    Complete control\n    ----------------\n\n    The last hook is to simply overload the ``modules_to_install``\n    method, which implements all the mechanisms above. This method\n    takes the usual set of parameters (cr, uid, ids, context) and\n    returns a ``set`` of addons to install (addons selected by the\n    above methods minus addons from the *basic* set which are already\n    installed) [#]_ so an overloader can simply manipulate the ``set``\n    returned by ``ResConfigInstaller.modules_to_install`` to add or\n    remove addons.\n\n    Skipping the installer\n    ----------------------\n\n    Unless it is removed from the view, installers have a *skip*\n    button which invokes ``action_skip`` (and the ``cancel`` hook from\n    ``res.config``). Hooks and additionals *are not run* when skipping\n    installation, even for already installed addons.\n\n    Again, setup your hooks accordingly.\n\n    .. [#] note that since a mapping key needs to be hashable, it's\n           possible to use a tuple or a frozenset, but not a list or a\n           regular set\n\n    .. [#] because the already-installed modules are only pruned at\n           the very end of ``modules_to_install``, additionals and\n           hooks depending on them *are guaranteed to execute*. Setup\n           your hooks accordingly.\n    "

The randomization can happen within a \"page\".\n\n        Using the same model for questions and pages allows to put all the pages and questions together in a o2m field\n        (see survey.survey.question_and_page_ids) on the view side and easily reorganize your survey by dragging the\n        items around.\n\n        It also removes on level of encoding by directly having 'Add a page' and 'Add a question'\n        links on the tree view of questions, enabling a faster encoding.\n\n        However, this has the downside of making the code reading a little bit more complicated.\n        Efforts were made at the model level to create computed fields so that the use of these models\n        still seems somewhat logical. That means:\n        - A survey still has \"page_ids\" (question_and_page_ids filtered on is_page = True)\n        - These \"page_ids\" still have question_ids (questions located between this page and the next)\n        - These \"question_ids\" still have a \"page_id\"\n\n        That makes the use and display of these information at view and controller levels easier to understand.\n    "
